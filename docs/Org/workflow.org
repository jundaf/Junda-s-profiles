** DONE Shell programming with bash
   CLOSED: [2014-02-14 √ñ√ú√é√• 09:52]

*** Variables/Arrays
If you want to assign a value which contains spaces, be sure to quote it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # wrong:
  foo=x y z # sets foo to x; will try to execute y on z
  # right:
  foo="x y z" # sets foo to "x y z"
#+END_SRC

**** Operations on variables
     - String replacement
       - Bash can replace a string with another string: ${foo/cat/dog}
       - To replace all instances of a string: ${foo//cat/dog}
       - The ${name#pattern} operation removes the shortest prefix of
         ${name} matching pattern, while ## removes the longest
       - The operator % is the same, except for suffixes instead of prefixes
**** String/array manipulation
     - the prefix operator # counts the number of characters in a
       string or the number of elements in an array.
       - ${#ARRAY} is the same as ${#ARRAY[0]}
       - ${#ARRAY[@]}
**** Existence testing
     - Operator '-' and ':-' (variable is set and not empty)
     - Operator '=' and ':='
     - Operator '+' (opposite to '-')
**** Indirect look-up
     - Bash allows indirect variable/array look-up with the ! prefix operator.
     - That is, ${!expr} behaves like ${${expr}}
**** Array quirks: * versus @
     - they have subtly different behavior when quoted
     - "$*" combines all arguments into a single string
     - "$@" requotes the individual arguments
     - if the variable IFS (internal field separator) is set, then the
       contents of this variable are spliced between elements in "$*".

*** Expressions and arithmetic
The (( assignable = expression )) assignment notation is more forgiving:

 (( x = 3 + 12 )); echo $x    # prints 15
 (( x = 3 * 12 )); echo $x    # prints 36

If you want the result of an arithmetic expression without assigning it, you can use $((expression)):

 echo $(( 3 + 12 ))   # prints 15
 echo $(( 3 * 12 ))   # prints 36

*** Pipes
 Some program accept a filename from which to read instead of reading from STDIN.

For these programs, or programs which accept multiple filenames, there is a way to create a temporary file that contains the output of a command, the <(command) form.

The expression <(command) expands into the name of a temporary file that contains the output of running command.

This is called process substitution.

 # appends uptime, date and last line of event.log onto main.log:
 cat <(uptime) <(date) <(tail -1 event.log) >> main.log

*** Globs and patterns
{string1,string2,...,stringN} expands to string1 or string2 or ...

It is possible to create a "bash bomb": a pattern that grows
exponentially in size under expansion:

 echo {0,1}              # prints 0 1

 echo {0,1}{0,1}         # prints 00 01 10 11

 echo {0,1}{0,1}{0,1}    # prints 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

** DONE Dependency Injection Pattern (Martin Fowler)
   CLOSED: [2014-02-14 √ñ√ú√é√• 13:53]
*** Inversion of Control
    - The question, is what aspect of control are they inverting?
    - the inversion is about how they lookup a plugin implementation.
*** Forms of Dependency Injection
    - The basic idea of the Dependency Injection is to have a
      separate object, an assembler, that populates a field in the
      lister class with an appropriate implementation for the finder
      interface
    - There are three main styles of dependency injection.
      - Constructor Injection, PicoContainer
      - Setter Injection, Spring
      - Interface Injection.
*** Using a Service Locator
    - The basic idea behind a service locator is to have an object
      that knows how to get hold of all of the services that an
      application might need.
*** Deciding which option to use
    - both implementations provide the fundamental decoupling
    - The important difference between the two patterns is about how
      that implementation is provided to the application class.
    - Using dependency injection can help make it easier to see what
      the component dependencies are.
    - A common reason people give for preferring dependency injection
      is that it makes testing easier.
**** Constructor versus Setter Injection
     - The advantage of injection is primarily that it requires very
       simple conventions - at least for the constructor and setter
       injections.
     - should you fill fields in a constructor or with setters.
       - My long running default with objects is as much as possible,
	 to create valid objects at construction time.
       - Another advantage with constructor initialization is that it
	 allows you to clearly hide any fields that are immutable by
	 simply not providing a setter.
     - Despite the disadvantages my preference is to start with
       constructor injection, but be ready to switch to setter
       injection as soon as the problems I've outlined above start to
       become a problem.
**** Code or configuration files
     - My advice here is to always provide a way to do all configuration
       easily with a programmatic interface, and then treat a separate
       configuration file as an optional feature.
**** Separating Configuration from Use
     - The important issue in all of this is to ensure that the
       configuration of services is separated from their use.
     - Indeed this is a fundamental design principle that sits with
       the separation of interfaces from implementation.

    - Using variables and the clipboard
      - With the exception of local variables in functions, all
       	variables are global
      - variables are not declared; they come into existence simply by
       	using them (and each variable starts off empty/blank).
      - The parentheses signify that the if-statement contains an
       	*expression*.
      - The variable named Clipboard is special because it contains the
       	current text on the Windows clipboard.
      - In the above, `r and `n (accent followed by the letter "r" or
       	"n") are used to indicate two special characters: carriage
       	return and linefeed.
